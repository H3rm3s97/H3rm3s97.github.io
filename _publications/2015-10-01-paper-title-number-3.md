collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-03-20
excerpt: 'In this preprint, the concepts of universal special function and universal dual
special function are introduced. Moreover, it is proved
that their scalar product is rational, and that the latter can be expressed as an
Eisenstein-like series
over the lattice of a Drinfeld module of arbitrary rank, generalizing previous results of the
author'
