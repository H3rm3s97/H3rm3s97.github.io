I am a Math Ph.D. student at Sapienza Universit√† di Roma. I graduated with honors at Scuola Normale Superiore, one of the most prestigious Italian universities, which I attended with a full scholarship. My research interests are Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory, with a particular focus on the theory of Anderson modules.
